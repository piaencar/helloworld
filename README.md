How is Git/GitHub relevant to me at all?
- These will help organize my files and will help me visualize the development/history of my project which are useful when I want to make certain improvements/fixes.
- These make it easier for projects that are worked on in teams with its distributed version control functionalities.
- GitHub serves as a platform for Open Source Development, which will not only help myself but others that are interested in the same project/s.
